# Skill Evolver — Technical Experience Base

This skill maintains a structured record of **what works and what doesn't** from past Claude Code sessions. It tracks three categories of experience:

| Category | File | What it captures |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **Success** | `tmp/success_experience.yaml` | Approaches and patterns that worked well |
| **Failure** | `tmp/failure_experience.yaml` | Approaches that failed or caused problems |
| **Tips** | `tmp/useful_tips.yaml` | Non-obvious shortcuts, workarounds, and techniques |

When experience accumulates enough evidence, the evolution process creates standalone Claude Code skills from it.

## Data Location

All data files are at `~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/`.

### tmp/ — Accumulated Experience

```yaml
# Example entry in tmp/success_experience.yaml
entries:
  - content: "Running tsc --noEmit before committing TypeScript catches type errors early"
    signals:
      - session: "sess-001"
        date: "2026-02-28"
        detail: "Agent ran tsc first, caught type error before commit"
    first_seen: "2026-02-28"
    last_seen: "2026-03-02"
    times_seen: 2
    applicable_to: ["typescript"]
```

### reference/ — Metadata

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `reference/permitted_skills.md` | Skills created by the evolution process (modifiable) |
| `reference/runtime_guide.md` | How to use stored experience during normal work |
| `reference/evolution_guide.md` | Full manual for the evolution cycle |

## How to Use This Skill

### During normal work (runtime)

Read `reference/runtime_guide.md` for instructions on how to leverage stored experience — check for known failures before trying risky approaches, and apply proven success patterns.

### During an evolution cycle (background task)

Read `reference/evolution_guide.md` for the full operational manual on scanning session logs, adding signals, creating skills, and managing the experience base.
