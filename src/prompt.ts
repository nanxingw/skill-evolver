1. **Browse session logs** — Scan recent Claude Code session logs at \`~/.claude/projects/\` (JSONL files). Focus on sessions you haven't analyzed yet (check your previous reports for reference). Each JSONL line has type, message.content, sessionId, timestamp, cwd fields.

2. **Use user-context skill** — Extract user preferences, objectives, and cognitive patterns from session logs. Update tmp YAML files with new signals. Graduate entries from tmp to context when Claude's graduation guidelines are met.

3. **Use skill-evolver skill** — Accumulate success/failure experiences and useful tips. When you identify recurring patterns with broad applicability, create new standalone skills or update existing ones you have permission to modify (check permitted_skills.md).

4. **Write completion report** — Write a brief markdown report summarizing what you did in this cycle to:
   \`${reportPath}\`
   Include: sessions analyzed, signals extracted, any graduations or skill changes made, and notes for next cycle.

5. **Task Planning** — Read the task-planner skill at \`~/.claude/skills/task-planner/\`.
   - Read buffer/ideas.yaml, existing tasks at \`~/.skill-evolver/tasks/tasks.yaml\`, and _rejected.yaml
   - Freely add/remove ideas, create tasks if appropriate
   - One-shot tasks should be scheduled before next cycle
   - Record decisions in the evolution report
   - **Task auto-approve is ${opts?.taskAutoApprove !== false ? "ON" : "OFF"}**. ${opts?.taskAutoApprove !== false ?

1. **Read your previous reports** (provided below) to know what sessions you already processed.

2. **Find new sessions** using \`list-sessions.mjs --since <last-run-date>\`. Identify sessions you haven't analyzed yet.

3. **Extract user signals** from session logs using session-digest.mjs and search-messages.mjs. Look for:
   - **Preferences**: Tool choices, code style, workflow habits, communication patterns
   - **Objectives**: New projects, goals mentioned, recurring themes
   - **Cognition**: Decision-making style, personality traits, communication patterns

4. **ADD SIGNAL** to the appropriate tmp file. If a matching entry exists, append a new signal. If not, create a new entry.

5. **Check graduation conditions**: An entry graduates from tmp to context when it has **3+ signals spanning 2+ days** with no contradictions. When graduating:
   - Add the entry to the corresponding context file
   - Sum the signal count into \`source_signals\`
   - Remove from tmp

6. **Clean stale entries**: Remove tmp entries with \`last_seen\` 60+ days ago and only 1-2 signals.

7. **Write report** to:

  const task = `
${SCRIPTS_REFERENCE}

## Your Workflow

### Step 1: Need Discovery (MANDATORY — do not skip)

You must identify user needs from multiple sources. This is your most important step.

**Source A — User objectives**
Read \`~/.claude/skills/user-context/context/objective.yaml\`.
For each objective, ask: "What skill would help the user achieve this more effectively?"

**Source B — User preferences**
Read \`~/.claude/skills/user-context/context/preference.yaml\`.
Do any preferences imply a standardized workflow that could be captured as a skill?

**Source C — Accumulated experience**
Read all files in \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/\`.
- Recurring success patterns → could crystallize into a skill
- Recurring failure patterns → could become a preventive skill
- Useful tips with 3+ signals → strong candidates for skill creation

**Source D — Session logs**
Use scripts to scan recent sessions. Look for:
- Operations the user repeatedly performs manually (automate as skill)
- Things the user repeatedly explains to Claude (should be in a skill)
- Difficulties or friction points (skill can provide pre-built solutions)

**Source E — Task execution patterns (IMPORTANT — co-evolution)**
Read \`~/.skill-evolver/tasks/tasks.yaml\` for the task inventory, then browse recent task reports in \`~/.skill-evolver/tasks/*/reports/\`. Look for:
- Tasks that failed repeatedly → a skill could prevent the failure pattern
- Tasks where the agent had to improvise or figure things out → codify that knowledge as a skill
- Tasks that always need certain boilerplate or setup → extract as a utility skill
- Multiple tasks sharing similar patterns → a common skill would help all of them

**Source F — Skill-need signals (PRIORITY)**
Read \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/skill_needs.yaml\`. These are high-priority needs emitted by post-task reviews when tasks struggle or fail. Address these FIRST before other needs. After addressing a need, set its \`addressed\` field to \`true\`.

**Output**: List of identified needs (at least 3) in your report.

### Step 2: Match Against Existing Skills

List all skills in \`~/.claude/skills/\` using: \`ls ~/.claude/skills/\`
For each identified need, check if an existing skill covers it.
- If covered and working well → note it, move on
- If covered but needs improvement → mark for evolution (Step 4)
- If not covered → move to Step 3

### Step 3: Search External Skills

Before creating from scratch, search for existing skills:

1. **SkillHub**: Use WebSearch or WebFetch to search \`https://www.skillhub.club/\` for relevant skills
2. **GitHub**: Use Bash to search: \`gh search repos "claude code skill <keyword>" --limit 5\` or WebSearch for "claude code skill <keyword> site:github.com"
3. **Anthropic official**: Check \`https://github.com/anthropics/\` for official skills

If you find a suitable external skill:
- Download it to a temp directory: \`git clone <repo> /tmp/skill-download-<name>\`
- Review its SKILL.md for quality and safety
- Copy to \`~/.claude/skills/<name>/\`
- Adapt/modify to fit the user's specific needs
- Register in \`permitted_skills.md\`

If nothing suitable found → proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Create or Evolve Skills (using skill-creator)

You MUST use skill-creator methodology when creating or evolving skills. Read \`~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md\` first.

**Creating a new skill:**
1. Read \`~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md\` thoroughly for best practices
2. **Design the skill** following skill-creator's anatomy:
   - Write a precise \`description\` in the YAML frontmatter — this is the PRIMARY trigger mechanism. Make it "pushy" (include specific contexts and keywords that should trigger it)
   - Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; use \`references/\` for detailed docs
   - Follow progressive disclosure: metadata → SKILL.md body → bundled resources
3. **Write basic evals** — create \`~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/evals/evals.json\` with 2-3 realistic test prompts:
   \`\`\`json
   {
     "skill_name": "<skill-name>",
     "evals": [
       { "id": 1, "prompt": "Realistic user prompt that should trigger this skill", "expected_output": "What the skill should produce" }
     ]
   }
   \`\`\`
4. **Register** the skill name in \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/reference/permitted_skills.md\`

**Evolving an existing skill:**
1. Only modify skills listed in \`permitted_skills.md\`
2. Read the skill's existing SKILL.md and any evals
3. Use Edit for targeted changes — don't rewrite entire files unless necessary
4. Base changes on accumulated experience evidence
5. If the skill has \`evals/evals.json\`, consider updating the evals to cover new scenarios
6. **Update the existing entry in-place** in \`permitted_skills.md\` — do NOT append a duplicate entry. Use the Edit tool to replace the old line with updated info.

**Skill quality checklist** (from skill-creator):
- [ ] Clear, actionable instructions using imperative form
- [ ] Explains the **why** behind instructions, not just rigid rules
- [ ] Description is trigger-optimized (pushy, includes keywords and contexts)
- [ ] Under 500 lines for SKILL.md; references/ for detailed content
- [ ] Scoped to one coherent topic, no duplication with existing skills
- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter with name and description

### Step 5: Experience Maintenance

Continue maintaining the experience base — it helps you make better decisions:
- **ADD SIGNAL**: When you find success/failure/tip patterns in session logs, add them to the appropriate tmp file
- **CLEAN STALE**: Remove entries with \`last_seen\` 60+ days ago and only 1-2 signals
- Experience data is your **decision reference**, not a graduation queue

### Step 6: Write Report

Write your report to:
\`${reportPath}\`

**MANDATORY report sections** (you must answer all of these):

\`\`\`markdown
# Skill Agent Report — {date}

## Needs Discovered
(List at least 3 identified user needs with evidence source)

1. Need: ...
   Source: objective/preference/experience/session/task-execution/skill-need-signal
   Evidence: ...

## Existing Skill Coverage
(For each need, which existing skills cover it? Any gaps?)

## External Skill Search
(What did you search for? What did you find? Any downloads?)

## Skills Created or Evolved
(List any new skills created or existing skills modified. If none, explain why for EACH unmet need.)

## Task-Derived Needs
(What skill needs were identified from task execution patterns? Any skill_needs.yaml signals addressed?)

## Experience Updates
- success_experience: N signals added

- \`~/.claude/skills/task-planner/tasks/_rejected.yaml\` (rejection tracking)

**Read access:**
- \`~/.claude/skills/user-context/context/\` and \`tmp/\` (user profile)
- \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/\` (technical experience)
- \`~/.claude/skills/\` (skill inventory — list all available skills)

  const task = `
${SCRIPTS_REFERENCE}

## Your Workflow

### Phase 1: Objective Decomposition (MANDATORY — do not skip)

This is your most important step. You MUST complete it for every objective.

Read \`~/.claude/skills/user-context/context/objective.yaml\`. For **each** objective:

1. What is the current status of this objective? (Infer from session logs)
2. What recurring checks, monitoring, or automation could help?
3. What information gathering would be valuable?

**Decomposition template** (use for each objective):
\`\`\`
Objective: "<objective text>"
  Current status: <inferred from session logs>
  Potential tasks:
    - <task idea 1> (type: info-gathering / quality-check / monitoring / project-work)
    - <task idea 2>
  Decision: <create / skip (with specific reason)>
\`\`\`

### Phase 2: Experience-Driven Tasks

Read \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/\`:
- **failure_experience.yaml** → Is there a preventive check task that could catch these failures early?
- **success_experience.yaml** → Is there a task to systematically apply proven approaches?
- **useful_tips.yaml** → Any tips that suggest a useful monitoring task?

### Phase 3: Session Pattern Analysis

Use scripts to scan recent sessions:
- What does the user repeatedly do manually? (→ automate)
- What information does the user repeatedly query? (→ scheduled report)
- What errors keep recurring? (→ preventive check)

### Phase 4: Skill Awareness (IMPORTANT — co-evolution)

Understand what skills are available so you can leverage them and identify gaps:

1. **List available skills**: \`ls ~/.claude/skills/\`
2. **Check evolved skills**: Read \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/reference/permitted_skills.md\`
3. **For each task you plan to create**, consider:
   - Which existing skills could help this task execute better? → set \`relatedSkills\` field
   - Does this task need a skill that doesn't exist yet? → create a **skill-building task**
4. **Detect skill gaps**: If an objective requires capabilities no existing skill provides, create a skill-building task to fill that gap

### Phase 5: Task Lifecycle Management

Read existing tasks from \`~/.skill-evolver/tasks/tasks.yaml\`:
- Check artifact quality (browse \`~/.skill-evolver/tasks/<id>/artifacts/\`)
- Is the schedule still appropriate?
- Should any task be adjusted, paused, or removed?
- For skill-building tasks: has the target skill been created? If yes → mark completed

### Phase 6: Decision and Creation

Combine analysis from Phases 1-5. Create tasks following the schema in \`~/.claude/skills/task-planner/reference/task_schema.md\`.

**Task safety tiers** (prefer safer categories first):
1. **Information gathering** — Always safe: news, trends, summaries, monitoring
2. **Quality checks** — Low risk: lint, type-check, dependency audit, security scan
3. **Project monitoring** — Low risk: progress tracking, status reports
4. **Project work** — Medium risk: code generation, documentation

**Auto-approve is ${autoApprove ? "ON" : "OFF"}**. ${autoApprove ? "Set agent-created tasks to `status: active` and `approved: true` — they will run immediately on schedule." : "Set agent-created tasks to `status: pending` and `approved: false` — user must approve via dashboard."}

**Check \`~/.claude/skills/task-planner/tasks/_rejected.yaml\`** before creating — do not re-propose rejected tasks.

**Standard task format** (append to tasks array in tasks.yaml):
\`\`\`yaml
- id: "t_YYYYMMDD_HHmm_xxx"    # date + 3-char random hex
  name: "Short descriptive name"
  description: "What and why"
  prompt: "Full self-contained prompt for Claude"
  schedule:
    type: cron               # or "one-shot"
    cron: "0 8 * * *"       # 5-field cron
  status: ${autoApprove ? "active" : "pending"}
  approved: ${autoApprove ? "true" : "false"}
  source: agent
  model: sonnet              # Prefer sonnet unless deep reasoning needed
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
  relatedSkills: ["skill-name"]   # optional: skills this task should leverage
  runCount: 0
  createdAt: "<ISO datetime>"
\`\`\`

**Skill-building task format** (special task type for creating/improving skills):
\`\`\`yaml
- id: "t_YYYYMMDD_HHmm_xxx"
  name: "Create <skill-name> skill"
  description: "Create a skill for <what it does> based on <evidence>"
  prompt: |
    You are a skill builder. Your task is to create (or improve) a Claude Code skill
    using the skill-creator methodology.

    TARGET SKILL: <skill-name>
    GOAL: <what the skill should do>
    EVIDENCE: <why this skill is needed — specific patterns, failures, or user needs>

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Read ~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md THOROUGHLY — it defines the
       standard process for skill creation including eval, benchmark, and description optimization.
    2. Check if ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/ already exists
       - If exists: Read current SKILL.md, identify improvements, make targeted edits
       - If new: Create the skill directory and write SKILL.md following skill-creator's anatomy:
         - YAML frontmatter with name and trigger-optimized description (make it "pushy")
         - Instructions using imperative form, explaining WHY not just WHAT
         - Under 500 lines; use references/ for detailed docs
    3. Write basic evals to ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/evals/evals.json with 2-3
       realistic test prompts and expected outputs
    4. Register the skill in ~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/reference/permitted_skills.md
    5. Write a report summarizing: what was created/changed, eval results if any, description design rationale
  schedule:
    type: one-shot
    at: "<ISO datetime — schedule within next few hours>"
  status: ${autoApprove ? "active" : "pending"}
  approved: ${autoApprove ? "true" : "false"}
  source: agent
  model: sonnet
  tags: ["skill-building"]
  skillTarget: "<skill-name>"     # REQUIRED for skill-building tasks
  runCount: 0
  createdAt: "<ISO datetime>"
\`\`\`

**When to create a skill-building task:**
- An objective needs capabilities no existing skill provides
- Multiple tasks share patterns that should be codified
- Task failures reveal a knowledge gap that a skill could fill
- User repeatedly needs guidance in a specific domain

### Phase 7: Write Report

Write your report to:

  const task = `
${SCRIPTS_REFERENCE}

## Environment

Before running any evermem script, ensure the \`EVERMEMOS_API_KEY\` environment variable is set.
If it is not set in your environment, check for a \`.env\` file in common locations:

\`\`\`bash
# Check if already set
echo $EVERMEMOS_API_KEY

# If empty, try sourcing from known locations
if [ -z "$EVERMEMOS_API_KEY" ]; then
  for f in ~/.skill-evolver/.env ~/.autocode/.env; do
    [ -f "$f" ] && export $(grep EVERMEMOS_API_KEY "$f" | xargs) && break
  done
fi
\`\`\`

If the API key is not found anywhere, skip memory ingestion and note it in your report.

## Your Workflow

1. **Read your previous reports** (provided below) to know which sessions you already ingested. Track ingested session IDs to avoid duplicates.

2. **Find new sessions** using \`node ~/.claude/skills/user-context/scripts/list-sessions.mjs --since <last-run-date> --limit 20\`. Identify sessions you haven't ingested yet.

3. **Ingest sessions into EverMemOS** using the add-memories script:

   \`\`\`bash
   node ~/.claude/skills/evermem/scripts/add-memories.mjs --file <session-path> --flush --max-turns 100
   \`\`\`

   For efficiency, you can also batch-ingest recent sessions:

   \`\`\`bash
   node ~/.claude/skills/evermem/scripts/add-memories.mjs --recent <N> --flush
   \`\`\`

   **Important:**
   - Use \`--flush\` to ensure immediate memory extraction on the last message
   - Limit to \`--max-turns 100\` to avoid excessive API calls on very long sessions
   - The script automatically extracts only user text and assistant text (filters out tool calls, thinking, etc.)

4. **Optionally verify** by searching for a recently ingested memory:

   \`\`\`bash
   node ~/.claude/skills/evermem/scripts/search-memories.mjs --query "<recent topic>" --top-k 3
   \`\`\`

5. **Write report** to:
   \`${reportPath}\`

\`\`\`markdown
# Memory Agent Report — {date}

## Sessions Ingested
(list session IDs, projects, and message counts)

## Sessions Skipped
(already ingested or too old)

## API Stats

## Your Review Task

1. **Review quality** — Assess whether the task was completed successfully. Note any issues or areas for improvement.

2. **Update skill-evolver experience** — Based on the task outcome:
   - Add success experiences to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/success_experience.yaml\` if the task demonstrated effective approaches.
   - Add failure experiences to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/failure_experience.yaml\` if something went wrong.
   - Add useful tips to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/useful_tips.yaml\` for any non-obvious learnings.

3. **Emit skill-need signals (IMPORTANT — task-skill co-evolution)** — If the task struggled, failed, or had to improvise in a domain where a skill could help:
   - Write a skill-need signal to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/skill_needs.yaml\`
   - Format:
   \`\`\`yaml
   entries:
     - need: "Description of what skill is needed"
       source_task: "${task.id}"
       task_name: "${task.name}"
       evidence: "Why this skill is needed — what went wrong or was difficult"
       priority: "high"    # high if task failed, medium if task struggled
       date: "<today ISO>"
       addressed: false
   \`\`\`
   - This signal will be picked up by the Skill Agent in the next evolution cycle as a priority need.

4. **Skill-building task verification** — If this task has \`tags: ["skill-building"]\` or \`skillTarget\`:
   - Check if the target skill was actually created at \`~/.claude/skills/<skillTarget>/SKILL.md\`
   - If created: verify it's registered in \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/reference/permitted_skills.md\`
   - If NOT created: note the failure and emit a skill-need signal so the Skill Agent can handle it

5. **Check if follow-up needed** — Determine if the task result warrants any follow-up actions (e.g., a new task, an update to user-context, a skill modification).

6. **Update idea buffer** — If the task outcome suggests new ideas for tasks or skills, add them to the idea buffer.

7. **Write review report** — Write a brief markdown report to:
   \`${reportPath}\`
   Include: quality assessment, lessons extracted, skill-need signals emitted, and any follow-up recommendations.`;
