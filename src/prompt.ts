## Your Task

1. **Browse session logs** — Scan recent Claude Code session logs at \`~/.claude/projects/\` (JSONL files). Focus on sessions you haven't analyzed yet (check your previous reports for reference). Each JSONL line has type, message.content, sessionId, timestamp, cwd fields.

2. **Use user-context skill** — Extract user preferences, objectives, and cognitive patterns from session logs. Update tmp YAML files with new signals. Graduate entries from tmp to context when Claude's graduation guidelines are met.

3. **Use skill-evolver skill** — Accumulate success/failure experiences and useful tips. When you identify recurring patterns with broad applicability, create new standalone skills or update existing ones you have permission to modify (check permitted_skills.md).

4. **Write completion report** — Write a brief markdown report summarizing what you did in this cycle to:
   \`${reportPath}\`
   Include: sessions analyzed, signals extracted, any graduations or skill changes made, and notes for next cycle.

5. **Task Planning** — Read the task-planner skill.
   - Read buffer/ideas.yaml, existing tasks, _rejected.yaml
   - Freely add/remove ideas, create tasks if appropriate
   - One-shot tasks should be scheduled before next cycle
   - Record decisions in the evolution report`;

## Artifacts Directory

Write any persistent artifacts (files, data, intermediate results) to:

This directory is shared across runs of this task and may contain artifacts from previous runs.

When you finish, write a brief markdown report summarizing what you accomplished to:

## Your Review Task

1. **Review quality** — Assess whether the task was completed successfully. Note any issues or areas for improvement.

2. **Update skill-evolver experience** — Based on the task outcome:
   - Add success experiences to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/success_experience.yaml\` if the task demonstrated effective approaches.
   - Add failure experiences to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/failure_experience.yaml\` if something went wrong.
   - Add useful tips to \`~/.claude/skills/skill-evolver/tmp/useful_tips.yaml\` for any non-obvious learnings.

3. **Check if follow-up needed** — Determine if the task result warrants any follow-up actions (e.g., a new task, an update to user-context, a skill modification).

4. **Update idea buffer** — If the task outcome suggests new ideas for tasks or skills, add them to the idea buffer.

5. **Write review report** — Write a brief markdown report to:
   \`${reportPath}\`
   Include: quality assessment, lessons extracted, and any follow-up recommendations.`;
